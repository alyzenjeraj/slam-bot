## SLAM BOT

This is my project to start learning ROS and autonomy. It's still a work in progress, but I've started to build out the URDF to model the robot in RVIZ and Gazebo, so I can test my code in simulation before bringing it to the real world. The robot uses a LiDAR to employ as SLAM algorithm to navigate within its environment and is also equipped with a RaspberryPi camera. I hope to use this for object classification in the future so the robot can make decisions on the objects it seems and map its trajectory accordingly. I also hope to eventually take the map and set waypoints so the robot can traverse it automatically.

## Some photos of what the physical robot looks like so far
THe design is based around a turtlebot, its got 2 motors to help it move around and runs off a RaspberryPi.
